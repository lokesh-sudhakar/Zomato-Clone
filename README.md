# Zomato-Clone
Zomato App Clone Project - using Zomato API

I have developed the Food Deliver application which is a clone of the actual Zomato 

I have used Google Maps to get user location and performed reverse Geocoding.
Users can search Nearest restaurant based on distance
Integrated Google login as authentication for the user.
